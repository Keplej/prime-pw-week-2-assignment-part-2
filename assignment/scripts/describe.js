// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name and set it to 'Dane'
// We then make an if...else statement and check if the name is equal (exact match only) to Mary
// If the name is not equal to 'Mary' we console.log 'How do you do?'
// If the name is equal to 'Mary' we console.log 'Hi, Mary'

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable and call it secret
// We make a variable called code and set it to 123
// We check if code is equal to 123. code is equal to 123,
// So then we run console.log secret and get super

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// Set up three conditional variables. First conditional is, isStudent equal to true, Second conditional is, age is equal to 34
// and the third conditonal zip is equal to 55407.
// Now check if isStudent is true  and if zip is greater then 80000 use the Logical Operator of && to check of both of these values are truthy.
// Which its not. Move down to the next else if statement. Check if the isStudent is truth and if age is less than 30. Have the
// logical Operator of || that checks if the two values are true or false. Both the isStudent and age are false.
// Check if isStudent true which it is
// So console.log 'Welcome to Prime!'

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*

//FIX - colorOne = 'red'; the instructions say it should be blue.
// The correct line should be colorOne = 'blue';
//FIX - colorTwo = 'blue'; the instructions say it should be red.
// The correct line should be colorTwo = 'red';

let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

//FIX - || - the instructions say and not or 
//The correct line should be if (temp > 39 && time >= 4)

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {

*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than minAge
// -- they are, so we console.log 'enter'.

const minAge = 21;
